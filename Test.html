<h2> Hurricane Dorian </h2>

<p> Hurricane Dorian continued its unrelenting assault on the Grand Bahama and Abaco Islands on Monday, causing “extreme destruction” as storm surges rose 12 to 18 feet above normal tide levels and at least five people were confirmed dead.</p>

<p> Forecasters said at 2 a.m. on Tuesday that the hurricane was stationary, even as its winds swirled at 120 m.p.h. After moving toward the islands over the weekend, it came to a halt on Monday evening above them. The hurricane moved just 14 miles from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m, and sat about 105 miles off the coast of Florida.</p>

<p> The storm had strengthened to Category 3 late Wednesday night, and by Thursday morning it was about 70 miles from Charleston, S.C., according to the National Hurricane Center. <br> Its hurricane-force winds were extending as far as 60 miles from the center, with tropical-storm-force winds extending up to 195 miles. Forecasters said storm surge waters could flood up to eight feet in some areas. Streets in Charleston were already flooding on Thursday morning with rising seas and rainfall expected to inundate parts of the city.</p>
