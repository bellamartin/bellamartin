<p> Hurricane Dorian continued its unrelenting assault on the Grand Bahama and Abaco Islands on Monday, causing “extreme destruction” as storm surges rose 12 to 18 feet above normal tide levels and at least five people were confirmed dead.</p>

<p> Forecasters said at 2 a.m. on Tuesday that the hurricane was stationary, even as its winds swirled at 120 m.p.h. After moving toward the islands over the weekend, it came to a halt on Monday evening above them. The hurricane moved just 14 miles from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m, and sat about 105 miles off the coast of Florida.</p>
